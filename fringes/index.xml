The main author will be on site to chat with you about mgmt, review your code, help you get your patch merged and listen to your design ideas for the project!
Come to get help implementing your first mgmt resource, write a new language function, or even get help writing your very first module! We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss and explain any internals that anyone is curious about.</description></item></channel></rss>
